Once you've verified these prerequisites, let's proceed to set up GroupDocs.Parser for your Java project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Parser for Java

To integrate the GroupDocs.Parser library into your Java application, follow these installation steps:

### Maven Configuration
If you're using Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-parser</artifactId>
      <version>25.5</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Parser for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/).

#### License Acquisition:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain one for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase**: For commercial use, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
After setting up the library, initialize it in your Java project:

```java
import com.groupdocs.parser.Parser;
```

With these steps completed, you're ready to implement text extraction from PDF documents using GroupDocs.Parser.

## Implementation Guide

Now that your environment is set up, let's dive into extracting raw text from a PDF document. We'll break this down into manageable steps for clarity.

### Extracting Raw Text from PDFs

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to extract and print the entire content of a PDF as plain text using GroupDocs.Parser.

#### Step 1: Initialize Parser
Create an instance of the `Parser` class pointing to your target document.

```java
try (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SamplePdf.pdf")) {
    // Code continues...
}
```

*Why?*: The `Parser` object is responsible for handling and processing the PDF file.

#### Step 2: Check Text Extraction Support
Verify if text extraction is supported by the document format.

```java
if (!parser.getFeatures().isText()) {
    System.out.println("Text extraction isn't supported");
    return;
}
```

*Why?*: Some documents may not support text extraction, so it's crucial to check this before proceeding.

#### Step 3: Extract and Print Text
Use the `getText` method to retrieve the documentâ€™s content as a string.

```java
try (TextReader reader = parser.getText(new TextOptions(true))) {
    String textContent = reader.readToEnd();
    // You can save this output to a file if needed
}
```

*Why?*: The `getText` method with `TextOptions` retrieves the entire document's text content. The `true` parameter indicates raw extraction.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your PDF is not encrypted or password protected.
- Validate that the document path is correct and accessible.
- Handle `IOException` to manage file access errors gracefully.

## Practical Applications

Leveraging GroupDocs.Parser for Java opens up a range of possibilities:

1. **Data Analysis**: Extract text from financial reports or scientific articles for further analysis.
