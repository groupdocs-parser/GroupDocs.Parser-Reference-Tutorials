# How to Implement HTML Keyword Searching Using GroupDocs.Parser in Java

## Introduction

Searching through large volumes of text can often feel like finding a needle in a haystack, especially when dealing with structured data formats such as HTML. Whether you're analyzing web content or extracting specific information from documents, efficiently searching for keywords is crucial. This tutorial will guide you through implementing keyword search functionality within an HTML document using GroupDocs.Parser Java.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and use GroupDocs.Parser for Java
- The process of searching for a keyword in an HTML document
- Extracting and displaying the position and text of each found instance

With these skills, you'll be able to enhance your applications with powerful content search capabilities. Let's dive into the prerequisites before we get started.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Parser for Java**: We will use version 25.5 of GroupDocs.Parser.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure your environment has JDK installed. Version 8 or higher is recommended.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A suitable IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, or you can compile from the command line using Maven or Gradle.
- Basic familiarity with Java programming concepts.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Parser for Java

To integrate GroupDocs.Parser into your Java project, follow these steps:

**Maven Configuration**

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-parser</artifactId>
      <version>25.5</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**

Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Parser for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/).

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: You can start with a free trial to explore GroupDocs features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license by visiting [GroupDocs Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more extended testing.
- **Purchase**: For production usage, purchase a commercial license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once you have the library integrated into your project, initialize GroupDocs.Parser as shown below:

```java
try (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.html")) {
    // Your code here for searching and processing.
} catch (ParseException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

With this setup complete, let's move on to implementing the keyword search feature.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to implement a keyword search within an HTML document using GroupDocs.Parser Java.

### Searching for a Keyword in an HTML Document

**Overview**

This functionality allows you to locate and process instances of a specific keyword throughout an HTML file. Here's how it works:

#### Step 1: Create Parser Instance
Begin by creating an instance of the `Parser` class, specifying the path to your HTML document.

```java
try (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.html")) {
    // Proceed with search operations.
} catch (ParseException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

#### Step 2: Search for a Keyword

Use the `search()` method to find occurrences of the desired keyword. Replace `"Sub1"` with your target keyword.

```java
Iterable<SearchResult> searchResults = parser.search("Sub1");
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- **Keyword**: The string you want to locate within the document.
- **Return Value**: An iterable collection of `SearchResult` objects, each representing a found instance.

#### Step 3: Extract and Display Results

Iterate over the search results to extract and display relevant information such as position and text.

```java
for (SearchResult result : searchResults) {
    int position = result.getPosition();
    String foundText = result.getText().trim();
    System.out.printf("Found at index %d: %s\
\
