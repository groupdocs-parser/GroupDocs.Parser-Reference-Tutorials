## Implementation Guide
### Extract & Format Email Text as HTML
This feature allows developers to extract text from emails and format it into HTML. The process involves initializing the parser with an email file and specifying the desired output format using `FormattedTextOptions`.

#### Step 1: Create an Instance of the Parser Class
Begin by creating a `Parser` instance, pointing it at your target email file:
```java
try (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.msg")) {
    // Proceed with extraction and formatting.
}
```
**Why?**: This step initializes the parsing context for your document, enabling you to access its content.

#### Step 2: Extract Formatted Text from the Document
Specify that you want the extracted text as HTML using `FormattedTextOptions`:
```java
try (TextReader reader = parser.getFormattedText(new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html))) {
    String htmlContent = reader.readToEnd();
}
```
**Why?**: This ensures the output is structured in a web-friendly format, ready for further manipulation or display.

#### Step 3: Read and Process the Extracted Text
The `readToEnd()` method reads all formatted content into a string:
```java
String htmlContent = reader.readToEnd();

// Additional processing can be done here with the 'htmlContent' variable.
```
**Why?**: Accessing the entire HTML-formatted text as a single string allows for comprehensive manipulation or integration within your application.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the email file path is correct and accessible.
- Check that you are using a compatible version of GroupDocs.Parser.

## Practical Applications
Integrating this feature can benefit various applications:
1. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Automatically format incoming emails for display on web platforms.
2. **Customer Support Tools**: Convert support tickets from email to HTML for better visualization in help desks.
3. **Data Migration Projects**: Transform legacy email content into modern formats for archival purposes.

## Performance Considerations
When processing large volumes of emails, consider the following tips:
- Optimize memory usage by carefully managing parser instances.
- Use efficient string handling techniques within Java.
- Leverage multi-threading if dealing with concurrent parsing tasks to improve throughput.

## Conclusion
You've learned how to extract and format email text as HTML using **GroupDocs.Parser** in Java. This capability can significantly enhance your application's ability to handle email content, making it more versatile and user-friendly.

Next steps include exploring further features of GroupDocs.Parser or integrating this solution into larger data processing pipelines.
