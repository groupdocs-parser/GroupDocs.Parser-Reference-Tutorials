```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up GroupDocs.Parser for Java, let's walk through extracting text from a PowerPoint presentation as HTML.

### Overview
Extracting text in HTML format enables seamless integration with web applications and simplifies content management workflows. 

#### Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
Begin by creating an instance of the `Parser` class using the path to your PowerPoint file:

```java
String pptxPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample-presentation.pptx";

try (Parser parser = new Parser(pptxPath)) {
    // Proceed with extraction steps...
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Options for HTML Extraction
Specify that you want to extract text in HTML format using `FormattedTextOptions`:

```java
double htmlOptions = new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html);
```

#### Step 3: Extract Text Using a TextReader
Create a `TextReader` instance to read the extracted content:

```java
try (TextReader reader = parser.getFormattedText(options)) {
    String formattedText = reader.readToEnd();
}
```

Here, `formattedText` contains your PowerPoint's text in HTML format.

### Troubleshooting Tips
