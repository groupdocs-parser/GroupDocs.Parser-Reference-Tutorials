# Mastering GroupDocs.Parser Java: Extract Text and TOC from SQLite Databases

**Introduction**

Are you looking to enhance your Java applications by extracting text and table of contents (TOC) from an SQLite database? This comprehensive guide will walk you through integrating GroupDocs.Parser with JDBC for seamless text extraction and TOC handling. Discover how this powerful combination can streamline data processing tasks in your projects.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How to set up a connection to an SQLite database using JDBC.
- The process of verifying text extraction capabilities with GroupDocs.Parser.
- Techniques for checking Table of Contents (TOC) support in your databases.
- Steps to extract and print table contents efficiently.

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine. Version 8 or above is recommended.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing Java code.
- Basic understanding of SQL and familiarity with JDBC concepts.

Additionally, you'll need to set up the GroupDocs.Parser library in your Java project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Parser for Java

To begin using GroupDocs.Parser with Java, follow these steps:

### Maven Setup

Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-parser</artifactId>
      <version>25.5</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Parser for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/java/).

#### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to evaluate the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license if you need more time.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for long-term use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Initialize GroupDocs.Parser by adding it to your project dependencies. This setup will allow you to leverage its powerful parsing features in your Java applications.

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the implementation into logical sections based on each feature.

### Initialize SQLite Database Connection

**Overview**: Establish a connection to an SQLite database using JDBC, enabling further data operations.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
```

#### Step 2: Create the Connection String and Connect
Create a `Connection` object using the SQLite JDBC URL format. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_database.db"` with your actual database path.

```java
String connectionString = String.format("jdbc:sqlite:%s\
