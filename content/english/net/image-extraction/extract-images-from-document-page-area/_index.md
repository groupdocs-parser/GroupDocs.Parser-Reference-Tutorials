## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Groupdocs.Parser for .NET to extract images from specific areas of a document page. This process allows you to precisely target and retrieve images based on defined coordinates and dimensions within the document.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine
- Groupdocs.Parser for .NET library. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/)
- A sample document file to use for image extraction
## Importing Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code to access the Groupdocs.Parser functionalities.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Parser Instance
Create an instance of the `Parser` class and provide the path to your sample document file.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.docx"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Define Extraction Options
Define the extraction options to specify the area from which you want to extract images. Use `PageAreaOptions` and provide a `Rectangle` representing the desired area on the page.
```csharp
PageAreaOptions options = new PageAreaOptions(new Rectangle(new Point(340, 150), new Size(300, 100)));
```
In this example:
- `(340, 150)` represents the top-left corner coordinate of the area
- `300` is the width of the area
- `100` is the height of the area
## Step 3: Extract Images
Invoke the `GetImages` method of the `Parser` instance, passing the defined `PageAreaOptions`. This will return an enumerable collection of `PageImageArea` objects containing extracted images.
```csharp
IEnumerable<PageImageArea> images = parser.GetImages(options);
```
## Step 4: Check Extraction Support
Verify if the extraction operation is supported for the specified document. If the `images` collection is `null`, images extraction is not supported.
```csharp
if (images == null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Page images extraction isn't supported");
    return;
}
```
## Step 5: Iterate Over Extracted Images
Loop through the `images` collection to process each extracted image. Extracted images are represented by `PageImageArea` objects, providing page index, rectangle details, and image type.
```csharp
foreach (PageImageArea image in images)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Page: {image.Page.Index}, Rectangle: {image.Rectangle}, Type: {image.FileType}");
    // Further processing can be done with each image
}
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have learned how to extract images from specific areas of a document using Groupdocs.Parser for .NET. This approach allows for precise image extraction based on defined coordinates, enabling targeted image retrieval from documents.
