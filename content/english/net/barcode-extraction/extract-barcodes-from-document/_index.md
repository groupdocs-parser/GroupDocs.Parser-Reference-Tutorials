## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract barcodes from documents step-by-step. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful document parsing library that enables developers to work with various document formats, including PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).

## Import Namespaces
First, import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
Initialize an instance of the `Parser` class by providing the path to your sample document.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf"))
{
    // Code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Check Barcodes Extraction Support
Verify if the document supports barcode extraction using GroupDocs.Parser.
```csharp
if (!parser.Features.Barcodes)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document doesn't support barcodes extraction.");
    return;
}
```
## Step 3: Extract Barcodes from the Document
Extract barcodes from the document using the `GetBarcodes()` method.
```csharp
IEnumerable<PageBarcodeArea> barcodes = parser.GetBarcodes();
```
## Step 4: Iterate Over Extracted Barcodes
Loop through the extracted barcodes to access each barcode's details such as page index and value.
```csharp
foreach (PageBarcodeArea barcode in barcodes)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Page: " + barcode.Page.Index.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine("Value: " + barcode.Value);
}
```
