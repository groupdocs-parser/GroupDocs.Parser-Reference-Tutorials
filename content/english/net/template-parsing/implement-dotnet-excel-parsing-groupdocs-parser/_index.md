       throw new NotSupportedException("Worksheet cells extraction isn't supported");
   }
   ```
3. **Retrieve Worksheet Information:**
   Fetch and iterate through each worksheet's details.

   IEnumerable<WorksheetInfo> info = parser.GetWorksheetInfo();
   foreach (WorksheetInfo worksheet in info)
   {
       Console.WriteLine(worksheet.Name);
   }
   ```
### Extract Cells from Worksheets
**Overview:** Focus on extracting cell data, including their positions and contents.
#### Steps:
1. **Retrieve Worksheet Information:**
   Similar to the previous step, get details of all worksheets.
2. **Extract Cell Data:**
   For each worksheet, extract cells using its index.
   ```csharp
   foreach (WorksheetInfo worksheet in info)
   {
       IEnumerable<WorksheetCell> cells = parser.GetWorksheetCells(worksheet.Index);
       foreach (WorksheetCell cell in cells)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Row: {cell.RowIndex} Column: {cell.ColumnIndex}");
           Console.WriteLine(cell.Text);
       }
   }
   ```
