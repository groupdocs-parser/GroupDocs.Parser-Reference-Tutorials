### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with using command-line interface or package manager tools in your development environment.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Parser for .NET
Getting started is straightforward. Here’s how you can install the GroupDocs.Parser library:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Parser
```

**Using Package Manager:**

### License Acquisition Steps
To get started with a trial:
1. Visit [GroupDocs’ Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) to obtain a temporary license.
2. Follow the instructions to apply your license, unlocking full access for evaluation purposes.

After acquiring a temporary or purchased license, initialize and set up GroupDocs.Parser by creating an instance of the `Parser` class with the document file path as shown in our code snippets below.

## Implementation Guide
We’ll guide you through each feature step-by-step.

### Feature 1: Check Document Support for Formatted Text Extraction
**Overview:** This feature determines if a document supports formatted text extraction before attempting any operations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Initialize Parser and Check Features
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Parser;

public static void CheckDocumentSupport(string filePath)
{
    // Create an instance of the Parser class
    using (Parser parser = new Parser(filePath))
    {
        // Verify if formatted text extraction is supported
        if (!parser.Features.FormattedText)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Document isn't supported for formatted text extraction.");
            return;
        }
    }
}
```
*Explanation:* This code snippet checks whether the document supports extracting text in a formatted manner. Performing this check avoids unnecessary processing on unsupported files.

### Feature 2: Get Document Information
**Overview:** Retrieve essential information about the document, such as page count, which can be vital for further processing.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Fetch Document Info
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Parser;

public static void GetDocumentInfo(string filePath)
{
    // Create an instance of Parser class
    using (Parser parser = new Parser(filePath))
    {
        // Retrieve document information
        IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();

        // Confirm if the document contains pages
        if (documentInfo.PageCount == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Document hasn't got any pages.");
            return;
        }
    }
}
```
*Explanation:* This snippet retrieves and checks the number of pages in a document. Knowing the page count is essential for iterating over each page to extract text.

### Feature 3: Extract Formatted Text from Document Pages as Markdown
**Overview:** Extract formatted text from each page using Markdown, preserving its styling during extraction.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Iterate and Extract Text
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Parser;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;

public static void ExtractFormattedTextAsMarkdown(string filePath)
{
    // Create an instance of Parser class
    using (Parser parser = new Parser(filePath))
    {
        // Get the document info
        IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();

        // Loop through each page to extract formatted text
        for (int p = 0; p < documentInfo.PageCount; p++)
        {
            // Extract formatted text into a reader in Markdown mode
            using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(p, new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Markdown)))
            {
                // Read and print the formatted text from the page
                Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
*Explanation:* This code iterates over each document page to extract its content in Markdown format. Using `FormattedTextOptions`, it ensures that the extracted text retains its original styling.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Parser for .NET isn't limited to just extracting Markdown-formatted text; here are a few practical applications:
1. **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Automate content extraction and formatting for blogs or articles.
2. **Legal Document Processing:** Extract key information from contracts while retaining their structure.
3. **Publishing Industry:** Convert document formats seamlessly for digital publications.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Parser, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Memory Management:** Always dispose of `Parser` objects properly to free resources.
- **Batch Processing:** For large documents or multiple files, process them in batches to avoid memory overload.
  
By following best practices for .NET memory management, you ensure your applications run efficiently.
