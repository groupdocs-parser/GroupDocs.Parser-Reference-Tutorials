## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the steps to extract HTML formatted text from a document.
### Feature: Extract Formatted Text as HTML
This feature allows you to pull rich-text content and convert it into an HTML format. Hereâ€™s how:
#### Step 1: Check Format Support
Before extracting, ensure that your document supports formatted text extraction:
```csharp
if (!parser.Features.FormattedText)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Formatted text extraction isn't supported.");
}
```
- **Explanation:** This check prevents errors by confirming support for the feature you intend to use.
#### Step 2: Extract HTML Formatted Text
Here's how to extract and display the content:
```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html)))
{
    string result = reader.ReadToEnd();
    // Output or process 'result' as needed, e.g., save it to a file.
}
```
- **Parameters & Return Values:**
  - `GetFormattedText` returns a `TextReader` object containing the document's text in HTML format.
- **Configuration Options:** You can specify different formats using `FormattedTextOptions`.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the document path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that your file type supports formatted text extraction with GroupDocs.Parser.
## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases:
1. **Content Migration:** Extract content from legacy documents for migration to web platforms.
2. **Data Analysis:** Pull data into analytical tools for insights without manual conversion.
3. **Automated Reporting:** Generate reports in HTML format for consistent presentation and sharing.
4. **Document Archiving:** Convert documents to HTML for easier archiving and searchability.
## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Manage memory efficiently by disposing of `Parser` instances with a `using` statement.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use asynchronous methods if available, especially when dealing with large files or multiple documents.
  - Regularly update to the latest version for improvements and bug fixes.
