## Implementation Guide

Learn how to convert text from Word documents to HTML using GroupDocs.Parser .NET. We’ll break this down step-by-step:

### Create an Instance of the Parser Class

#### Overview
Begin by creating an instance of the `Parser` class, which will allow us to handle the Word document.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Initialize the Parser**
   ```csharp
   using (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SampleDocx.docx"))
   {
       // Code for extracting text goes here
   }
   ```
   - Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SampleDocx.docx"` with the path to your Word document.
   - This step is crucial as it opens up the document for processing.

### Extract Formatted Text

#### Overview
Extract formatted text from the document and convert it into HTML format using `FormattedTextOptions`.

#### Implementation Steps
2. **Extract Text Using GetFormattedText**
   ```csharp
   using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html)))
   {
       string htmlContent = reader.ReadToEnd();
       // Use or save the HTML content as needed
   }
   ```
   - The `GetFormattedText` method is configured to extract text in HTML mode.
   - `htmlContent` now holds your document's content formatted as HTML.

### Key Configuration Options
- **FormattedTextMode.Html**: This option ensures that extracted text maintains its original formatting, making it suitable for web applications or further processing.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where converting Word documents to HTML is beneficial:
1. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Automate the integration of richly formatted content into your CMS.
2. **Web Publishing**: Convert reports and articles stored in Word format for easy web display.
3. **Data Migration**: Transform legacy document formats into modern, accessible HTML files.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Parser:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Monitor memory usage during parsing to prevent leaks or excessive consumption.
