        using (Parser parser = new Parser(filePath))
        {
            if (!parser.Features.FormattedTextExtraction)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Formatted text extraction isn't supported.");
                return;
            }

            // Extraction logic will go here
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through the steps to extract document text as HTML using GroupDocs.Parser.

### Extracting Formatted Text as HTML

**Overview**
This feature allows converting the content of a document into HTML format while preserving its original styling and layout. It's particularly useful for web applications that need to display rich text documents.

#### Step 1: Initialize Parser Object
Create an instance of the `Parser` class, which represents your document:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(filePath))
{
    // Ensure formatted text extraction is supported
    if (!parser.Features.FormattedTextExtraction)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Formatted text extraction isn't supported.");
        return;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Extract HTML Formatted Text
Use the `GetFormattedText` method to extract the document's content as HTML:
```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html)))
{
    string extractedText = reader.ReadToEnd();
    
    // Define the output file path
    string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/extracted_text.html";
    
    // Write the formatted text to an HTML file
    File.WriteAllText(outputPath, extractedText);
}
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- `FormattedTextOptions`: Configures how the text should be extracted. By using `FormattedTextMode.Html`, you instruct the parser to output HTML.
  
- `GetFormattedText()`: Returns a reader that allows reading formatted content from the document.

#### Step 3: Handle Exceptions
Wrap your code in try-catch blocks to manage potential errors gracefully:
```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```
**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that formatted text extraction is supported for the document type you're using.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Parser offers numerous practical applications, such as:
1. **Web Content Management**: Automatically converting documents to HTML for online publishing platforms.
2. **Data Migration**: Extracting content from legacy formats into modern web formats.
3. **Content Syndication**: Sharing formatted text across different platforms while maintaining style.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Parser, consider the following:
- **Memory Management**: Use `using` statements to ensure resources are released promptly.
- **Batch Processing**: If processing multiple files, handle them in batches to reduce memory usage.
