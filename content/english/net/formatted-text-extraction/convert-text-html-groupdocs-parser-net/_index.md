## Implementation Guide
Now, let's delve into the core functionality of extracting text as HTML using **GroupDocs.Parser**.
### Extracting Text as HTML
This feature allows you to convert document content into HTML format with ease. Here’s how:
#### Overview
The GroupDocs.Parser library facilitates extracting text from documents in various formats and converting it into HTML for further processing or display on web platforms.
#### Implementation Steps
##### Step 1: Load the Document
Begin by loading your target document using the Parser class.
```csharp
// Load the document
using (Parser parser = new Parser(documentPath))
{
    // Check if text extraction is supported
    if (!parser.Features.Text)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Text extraction isn't supported.");
        return;
    }
}
```
##### Step 2: Extract Text and Convert to HTML
Use the `GetFormattedText` method with HTML formatting options.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(documentPath))
{
    // Define text extraction options for HTML format
    FormattedTextOptions options = new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.Html);

    // Extract formatted text as HTML
    using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(options))
    {
        string htmlContent = reader.ReadToEnd();
        
        // Output the extracted HTML content
        Console.WriteLine(htmlContent);
    }
}
```
#### Key Configuration Options
- **FormattedTextOptions**: Customize how you want to extract formatted text. Here, we use `FormattedTextMode.Html`.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Parser.
