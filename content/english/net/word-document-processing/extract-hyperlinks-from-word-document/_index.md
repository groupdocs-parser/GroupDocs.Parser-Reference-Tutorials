## Introduction
GroupDocs.Parser for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to extract structured text and metadata from various document formats such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, and more. One common requirement in document processing is to extract hyperlinks from Word documents programmatically. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using GroupDocs.Parser to extract hyperlinks from a Word document step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET framework.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project to use the GroupDocs.Parser library.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.Xml;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
```
Follow these steps to extract hyperlinks from a Word document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET:
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
Initialize an instance of the `Parser` class with the path to your Word document.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.docx"))
{
    // Code for extracting hyperlinks will go here
}
```
## Step 2: Get the Reader Object for Document XML Representation
Inside the `using` block, obtain the `XmlReader` object from the parser to access the structured XML representation of the document.
```csharp
using (XmlReader reader = parser.GetStructure())
{
    // Code for extracting hyperlinks will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Iterate Over the Document XML
Utilize a loop to iterate through the XML structure of the document using the `XmlReader`.
```csharp
while (reader.Read())
{
    // Code for extracting hyperlinks will go here
}
```
## Step 4: Identify and Extract Hyperlinks
Within the loop, check for start elements that represent hyperlinks and extract the link attribute.
```csharp
if (reader.IsStartElement() && reader.Name == "hyperlink")
{
    string hyperlinkUrl = reader.GetAttribute("link");
    Console.WriteLine(hyperlinkUrl);
}
```
## Step 5: Compile and Run the Code
Compile and run your C# code to extract and print all hyperlinks present in the specified Word document.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract hyperlinks from a Word document programmatically. By following these steps, you can incorporate this functionality into your C# applications seamlessly.
