# Working with Password Protected Documents

## Introduction
In the world of document processing, handling password-protected files efficiently is crucial. GroupDocs.Parser for .NET offers robust capabilities to work with such documents seamlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the process of extracting text from password-protected documents using GroupDocs.Parser.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following set up:
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
- Development Environment: Have Visual Studio or any compatible IDE for .NET development.
- Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces for using GroupDocs.Parser in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Exceptions;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Password and Parser
First, define the password for the protected document and initialize the `Parser` instance with the specified password.
```csharp
string password = "123456";
// Create an instance of Parser class with the password:
using (Parser parser = new Parser("Your Sample File", new LoadOptions(password)))
{
    // Further code will go here
}
```
Replace `"Your Sample File"` with the path to your password-protected document.
## Step 2: Check Text Extraction Support
Next, check if text extraction is supported for the document.
```csharp
// Check if text extraction is supported
if (!parser.Features.Text)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Text extraction isn't supported.");
    return;
}
```
This step ensures that the document supports text extraction before proceeding.
## Step 3: Extract Text from Document
If text extraction is supported, proceed to extract the text content of the document.
```csharp
// Print the document text
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText())
{
    Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());
}
```
The `GetText()` method retrieves a `TextReader` instance from which you can read the document's text content.
## Step 4: Handle Invalid Password Exception
In case the provided password is incorrect or empty, catch and handle the `InvalidPasswordException`.
```csharp
catch (InvalidPasswordException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid password");
}
```
This ensures graceful handling of password-related issues during document parsing.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text from password-protected documents effectively. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications.
