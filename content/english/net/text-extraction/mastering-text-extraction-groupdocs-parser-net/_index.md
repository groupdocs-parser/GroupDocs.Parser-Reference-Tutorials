- **Purchase:** For long-term use, purchase a full license through their official site.
### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Parser in your project as follows:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Parser;

string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```
With the setup complete, let's move on to implementing specific features using GroupDocs.Parser.
## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Extract Document Text as HTML
This feature allows you to extract formatted text from documents while maintaining their original formatting. It is particularly useful for complex document structures like tables and lists.
#### Overview
We'll use the `GetFormattedText` method with options for plain text extraction, demonstrating how it preserves your document content's structure.
##### Step 1: Initialize Parser
First, create an instance of the Parser class:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(dataDir + "/SampleDocx.docx"))
{
    // Proceed to extract text
}
```
##### Step 2: Extract Formatted Text
Use `GetFormattedText` with `PlainText` mode for basic extraction needs:
```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetFormattedText(new FormattedTextOptions(FormattedTextMode.PlainText)))
{
    string extractedText = reader == null ? "Formatted text extraction isn't supported" : reader.ReadToEnd();
    // Output or further process 'extractedText'
}
```
##### Parameters and Configuration
- **FormattedTextOptions:** Specify the mode (PlainText, Html, etc.) for text extraction.
- **TextReader:** Used to read the extracted content.
**Troubleshooting Tip:** Verify that your document format is supported by GroupDocs.Parser to prevent null returns from `GetFormattedText`.
### Feature: File Handling with GroupDocs.Parser
This feature focuses on basic file operations like reading and processing entire documents.
#### Overview
We'll extract the full text of a document using the `GetText` method, ideal for applications requiring complete document analysis.
##### Step 1: Initialize Parser
Create an instance again:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(dataDir + "/SampleDocx.docx"))
{
    // Continue to extract full text
}
```
##### Step 2: Extract Full Text Content
Use `GetText` for extracting all content:
```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText())
{
    string fullText = reader.ReadToEnd();
    // Process or store 'fullText'
}
```
### Practical Applications
1. **Document Management Systems:** Automate the extraction and indexing of documents.
2. **Data Analysis Tools:** Extract text for further analysis or machine learning applications.
3. **Content Migration Projects:** Move content between different document management systems while preserving formatting.
## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Parser:
- **Manage Resources Wisely:** Dispose of resources properly to prevent memory leaks.
- **Batch Processing:** Process documents in batches if dealing with large volumes.
- **Utilize Asynchronous Methods:** Where possible, use asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations.
## Conclusion
