## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract text from specific areas of a document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful API that allows developers to parse and extract text, metadata, and other information from various document formats such as PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and more.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- Development Environment: Visual Studio or any preferred .NET development IDE.
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
- Sample File: Prepare a document (PDF, DOCX, etc.) from which you want to extract text.

## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
```
## Step 1: Instantiate the Parser Class
Create an instance of the `Parser` class by specifying the path to your sample document:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf"))
{
    // Your code goes here...
}
```
Replace `"YourSampleFile.pdf"` with the path to your actual document.
## Step 2: Extract Text Areas
Use the `GetTextAreas()` method to extract text areas from the document:
```csharp
IEnumerable<PageTextArea> areas = parser.GetTextAreas();
```
## Step 3: Check Support for Text Areas Extraction
Verify if text areas extraction is supported for the document type:
```csharp
if (areas == null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Page text areas extraction isn't supported");
    return;
}
```
## Step 4: Iterate over Extracted Areas
Iterate through each extracted text area to access page index, rectangle, and text value:
```csharp
foreach (PageTextArea area in areas)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Page: {area.Page.Index}, Rectangle: {area.Rectangle}, Text: {area.Text}");
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to utilize GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text from specific areas within a document. This process is valuable for scenarios where targeted text extraction is necessary for data processing and analysis.
