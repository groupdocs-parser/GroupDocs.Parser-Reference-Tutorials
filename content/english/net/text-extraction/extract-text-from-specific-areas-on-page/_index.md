## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract text from specific areas on a page using the GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library. GroupDocs.Parser simplifies the extraction of text from documents, allowing developers to target specific regions of interest within a document for text extraction. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex documents where precise text extraction is required for further processing or analysis.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
- Sample document files to test the text extraction.
## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces in your C# code file to access the GroupDocs.Parser functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Instantiate the Parser Class
To start extracting text from a document, create an instance of the `Parser` class by providing the path to your sample document file:
```csharp
// Create an instance of Parser class
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.docx"))
{
    // Continue with text extraction...
}
```
Replace `"YourSampleFile.docx"` with the path to your actual document file.
## Step 2: Check Text Areas Extraction Support
Before proceeding with text extraction, check if the document supports text areas extraction using the `Features` property of the `Parser` class:
```csharp
// Check if the document supports text areas extraction
if (!parser.Features.TextAreas)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document doesn't support text areas extraction.");
    return;
}
```
This step ensures that the document can be processed for extracting text areas.
## Step 3: Get Document Information
Retrieve basic information about the document using the `GetDocumentInfo()` method:
```csharp
// Get the document info
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();
```
This information includes the page count and other metadata about the document.
## Step 4: Iterate Over Document Pages
Iterate through each page of the document to extract text from specific areas:
```csharp
// Check if the document has pages
if (documentInfo.PageCount == 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document doesn't have any pages.");
    return;
}
// Iterate over pages
for (int pageIndex = 0; pageIndex < documentInfo.PageCount; pageIndex++)
{
    // Print current page number
    Console.WriteLine($"Page {pageIndex + 1}/{documentInfo.PageCount}");
    // Continue with text extraction from areas...
}
```
This loop processes each page of the document sequentially.
## Step 5: Extract Text from Specific Areas
Within the page iteration loop, retrieve text from specific areas of interest using `GetTextAreas()` method:
```csharp
// Iterate over page text areas
foreach (PageTextArea area in parser.GetTextAreas(pageIndex))
{
    // Print rectangle coordinates and text area value
    Console.WriteLine($"Rectangle: {area.Rectangle}, Text: {area.Text}");
}
```
This step extracts text from each defined area (such as bounding rectangles) on the page and displays the extracted text.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to extract text from specific areas on a page using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. Leveraging the capabilities of this library, developers can accurately retrieve text from targeted regions within documents for various applications.
