# Extract Text Structure

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text structure from various document formats. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful library that enables developers to extract structured text content from documents, such as PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, and more. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up GroupDocs.Parser, importing necessary namespaces, and extracting text structure step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET development.
- GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
- Your sample file (e.g., PDF, DOCX, XLSX) for text extraction.
## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Parser in your C# project, follow these steps to import the required namespaces:

In your C# file, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.Xml;
```
Now let's dive into extracting text structure using GroupDocs.Parser. Follow these steps:
## Step 1: Create Parser Instance
Initialize a Parser instance with your sample file path:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf"))
{
    // Continue with the extraction process...
}
```
## Step 2: Extract Text Structure
Use the `GetStructure()` method to extract the text structure to an XML reader:
```csharp
using (XmlReader reader = parser.GetStructure())
{
    if (reader == null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Text structure extraction isn't supported.");
        return;
    }
    // Continue reading and processing the XML document...
}
```
## Step 3: Process Extracted Structure
Read the XML document to search for specific elements like hyperlinks:
```csharp
while (reader.Read())
{
    if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element && reader.IsStartElement() && reader.Name.ToLowerInvariant() == "hyperlink")
    {
        string value = reader.GetAttribute("link");
        if (value != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(value);
        }
    }
}
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text structure from documents efficiently. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate text extraction capabilities into your .NET applications seamlessly.
