### License Acquisition

- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore the features.
- **Temporary License:** Apply for a temporary license if you need extended access without limitations.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a license for long-term use. Visit [GroupDocs Licensing](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more details.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, you can initialize GroupDocs.Parser in your application like this:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Parser;

namespace PdfTextExtractor
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const string pdfFilePath = "path/to/your/sample.pdf"; // Replace with actual file path

            using (Parser parser = new Parser(pdfFilePath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Initialization successful!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Extracting Raw Text from PDF Pages

This feature allows you to programmatically extract raw text from each page of a PDF document.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Parser

First, create an instance of the `Parser` class for your specific PDF file:

```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(pdfFilePath))
{
    // Further processing here
}
```

This step ensures that you have access to all functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Parser.

#### Step 2: Retrieve Document Information

To know how many pages the document has, retrieve the document information using `GetDocumentInfo`:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();
```

The `documentInfo.RawPageCount` property gives you the total number of pages in your PDF.

#### Step 3: Iterate Over Each Page

Use a loop to iterate through each page and extract text:

```csharp
for (int p = 0; p < documentInfo.RawPageCount; p++)
{
    using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText(p, new TextOptions(true)))
    {
        string pageText = reader.ReadToEnd();
        
        // Further processing with `pageText`
        Console.WriteLine($"Text from Page {p + 1}:\n{pageText}");
    }
}
```

The `GetText` method extracts raw text using specified options, where `TextOptions(true)` ensures that the text is retrieved in its original form.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues:** Ensure the file path to your PDF document is correct.
- **Library Version:** Confirm you're using a compatible version of GroupDocs.Parser.
- **Permissions:** Verify that your application has read access to the specified directory and files.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Extraction for Analysis:** Automatically extract data from large volumes of documents for analysis or reporting.
2. **Content Migration:** Migrate content from PDFs into different formats like databases or web pages.
3. **Automated Document Processing:** Integrate with workflow systems to automate document handling tasks.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Close `TextReader` objects after use to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing:** Process documents in batches if dealing with large datasets.
- **Memory Management:** Use `using` statements for automatic disposal of objects, reducing memory footprint.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up GroupDocs.Parser .NET and extract raw text from PDF pages. This powerful feature can streamline many document processing tasks, saving time and improving accuracy.

Next steps include exploring other features of GroupDocs.Parser or integrating it into your existing applications for enhanced functionality.
