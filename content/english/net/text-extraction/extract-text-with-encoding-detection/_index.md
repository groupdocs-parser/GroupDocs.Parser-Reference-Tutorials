## Introduction
GroupDocs.Parser for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to extract text, metadata, and other information from various document formats in their .NET applications. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using GroupDocs.Parser to extract text from documents while detecting the encoding. By following these steps, you'll be able to efficiently parse and work with different document types within your .NET projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- Visual Studio or any preferred .NET development environment installed on your system.
- Access to GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create LoadOptions with Encoding
First, create an instance of `LoadOptions` class to specify the document format and encoding for text extraction. In this example, we'll use the default ANSI encoding (code page 1251) for Word Processing documents.
```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions(FileFormat.WordProcessing, null, null, Encoding.GetEncoding(1251));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Parser and Extract Text
Next, create an instance of `Parser` class and pass the document path along with the `LoadOptions` instance to it. Then, retrieve the document info to check if it's a plain text document.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.docx", loadOptions))
{
    TextDocumentInfo info = parser.GetDocumentInfo() as TextDocumentInfo;
    if (info == null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Isn't a plain text document");
        return;
    }
    
    Console.WriteLine("Encoding: " + info.Encoding.WebName);
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text from documents with encoding detection. By following the steps outlined above, you can seamlessly integrate document parsing capabilities into your .NET applications.
