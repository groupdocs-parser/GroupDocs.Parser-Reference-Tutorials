## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text from a document in accurate mode. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful API that allows developers to work with various document formats in their .NET applications, enabling text extraction with precision and ease. By the end of this guide, you will be equipped to leverage the capabilities of GroupDocs.Parser to extract text from documents efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Environment Setup: Have a working environment with .NET installed.
- GroupDocs.Parser Installation: Download and install GroupDocs.Parser for .NET from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
- Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.
## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the implementation, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
First, create an instance of the `Parser` class by providing the path to your sample file.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile"))
{
    // Code implementation goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Check Text Extraction Support
Next, verify if the document supports text extraction using the `Features.Text` property.
```csharp
if (!parser.Features.Text)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document doesn't support text extraction.");
    return;
}
```
## Step 3: Get Document Info
Retrieve information about the document using `GetDocumentInfo()` method.
```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();
if (documentInfo.PageCount == 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Document doesn't have pages.");
    return;
}
```
## Step 4: Iterate Over Pages and Extract Text
Iterate through each page of the document and extract text using `GetText()` method.
```csharp
for (int p = 0; p < documentInfo.PageCount; p++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Page {p + 1}/{documentInfo.PageCount}");
    using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText(p))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());
    }
}
```
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered the process of extracting text from a document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate text extraction functionality into your .NET applications, enabling you to work with various document formats efficiently.
