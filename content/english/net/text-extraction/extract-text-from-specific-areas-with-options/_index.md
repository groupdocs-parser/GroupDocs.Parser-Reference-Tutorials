# Extract Text from Specific Areas with Options

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to extract text from specific areas within a document using customizable options. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful library that enables developers to parse and extract text from various document formats effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the coding, make sure you have the following:
1. Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or any other .NET development IDE.
2. GroupDocs.Parser Library: Download and install GroupDocs.Parser for .NET from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
3. Sample File: Prepare a sample document (e.g., PDF, DOCX, etc.) to extract text from.

## Import Namespaces
First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces to access the GroupDocs.Parser classes and methods.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
Initialize an instance of the `Parser` class by providing the path to your sample file.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf"))
{
    // Code for text area extraction will go here
}
```
## Step 2: Define Text Area Extraction Options
Create `PageTextAreaOptions` to specify the criteria for text extraction.
```csharp
PageTextAreaOptions options = new PageTextAreaOptions("\\s[a-z]{2}\\s", new Rectangle(new Point(0, 0), new Size(300, 100)));
```
In this example:
- `"\\s[a-z]{2}\\s"` is a regular expression pattern to match text areas containing only lowercase letters.
- `new Rectangle(new Point(0, 0), new Size(300, 100))` defines the rectangle (position and size) on the page from which to extract text.
## Step 3: Extract Text Areas
Use the defined options to extract text areas that meet the specified criteria.
```csharp
IEnumerable<PageTextArea> areas = parser.GetTextAreas(options);
```
## Step 4: Check and Iterate over Extracted Text Areas
Check if text area extraction is supported and then iterate over the extracted areas.
```csharp
if (areas == null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Page text areas extraction isn't supported");
    return;
}
foreach (PageTextArea a in areas)
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Page: {0}, R: {1}, Text: {2}", a.Page.Index, a.Rectangle, a.Text));
}
```

In this tutorial, we've covered how to extract text from specific areas within a document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. This library offers extensive capabilities for parsing various document formats, making it a valuable tool for text extraction tasks.
