### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize your project:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Parser;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pptx";
        using (Parser parser = new Parser(documentPath))
        {
            // Your code to extract text will go here.
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
This section walks you through extracting text from PowerPoint slides using GroupDocs.Parser.

### Overview
GroupDocs.Parser allows efficient document parsing and text extraction. Here's the process for PowerPoint presentations:

#### Step 1: Create a Parser Instance
Create an instance of the `Parser` class, specifying your document path:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pptx";
using (Parser parser = new Parser(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed with text extraction.
}
```

#### Step 2: Access Document Information
Retrieve details such as the number of slides:
```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = parser.GetDocumentInfo();
```

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Slides and Extract Text
Loop through each slide, extracting content with a `TextReader` object:
```csharp
for (int p = 0; p < documentInfo.PageCount; p++)
{
    using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText(p))
    {
        string slideText = reader.ReadToEnd();
        
        // Save or process the extracted text.
        File.WriteAllText($"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Slide{p + 1}.txt", slideText);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Components
- **Parser Class**: The entry point for document parsing. Requires a file path to initialize.
- **IDocumentInfo Interface**: Provides metadata about the document, like slide count.
- **TextReader**: Facilitates reading text content from each slide.

## Practical Applications
Extracting text from PowerPoint files enables several possibilities:
1. **Content Analysis**: Automatically summarize presentations for quick insights.
2. **Data Migration**: Convert presentation data into formats like HTML or PDF.
3. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Store key points directly in customer relationship management tools.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Parser:
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during large document processing tasks.
- **Optimization Tips**: Use asynchronous methods to improve responsiveness.
- **Best Practices for .NET Memory Management**:
  - Dispose of `TextReader` and other IDisposable objects promptly.
  - Use `using` statements for automatic resource cleanup.
