```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of the Parser Class
Begin by creating an instance of the `Parser` class, passing the path to your sample file as an argument.
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf"))
{
    // Continue with text extraction...
}
```
## Step 2: Extract Text into a TextReader
Next, extract the text from the document into a `TextReader` object.
```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText())
{
    // Continue with text processing...
}
```
## Step 3: Access Extracted Text
Now, you can access and process the extracted text from the document using the `TextReader`.
```csharp
string extractedText = reader == null ? "Text extraction isn't supported" : reader.ReadToEnd();
Console.WriteLine(extractedText);
```
