### License Acquisition Steps

Obtain a free trial, temporary license, or full purchase to unlock all features. Visit the [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for options.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

After installation, create an instance of the `Parser` class using your PDF document's path:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePdf.pdf"))
{
    // Your code here...
}
```

## Implementation Guide: Extracting Highlights from PDFs

### Overview

Extract highlights by identifying and retrieving text segments. This guide focuses on extracting a three-word highlight from a PDF document's second page using GroupDocs.Parser.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Initialize the Parser Object

Create an instance of the `Parser` class:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SamplePdf.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed to highlight extraction...
}
```
This prepares your document for processing.

#### Step 2: Extract a Highlight from the Document

Use `GetHighlight` to extract three words from a specified page:
```csharp
// '2' specifies the second page, and HighlightOptions(3) defines extracting three words.
HighlightItem hl = parser.GetHighlight(2, true, new HighlightOptions(3));
```

#### Step 3: Validate and Display the Extracted Highlight

Check if highlight extraction is supported. If successful, print the extracted text:
```csharp
if (hl == null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Highlight extraction isn't supported");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"At {hl.Box.X} - {hl.Text}");
}
```

### Key Configuration Options
- **Page Number**: Adjust to specify which page to extract from.
- **HighlightOptions**: Modify the number of words as needed.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that highlight extraction supports the PDF format you're using.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be used in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Legal Document Review**: Quickly extract key phrases for review.
2. **Research Summaries**: Highlight essential points in papers or reports.
3. **Automated Report Generation**: Create summaries of lengthy PDFs by extracting highlights.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Parser:
- Use efficient memory management practices to handle large documents.
- Ensure your system resources are adequate for processing complex tasks.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to extract three-word highlights from a PDF document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. This feature enhances document processing capabilities by quickly accessing key information within larger texts.
