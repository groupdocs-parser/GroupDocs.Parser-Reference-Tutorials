## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to efficiently extract text from PDF documents using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful library that allows developers to parse and extract text, metadata, and structured data from various document formats, including PDFs. Whether you're working on data extraction, content analysis, or search functionalities within your .NET applications, GroupDocs.Parser provides a comprehensive set of tools to handle these tasks seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Development Environment: Install Visual Studio or any preferred .NET development environment.
2. GroupDocs.Parser for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Parser for .NET library. You can find the library and its documentation [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
3. Sample PDF File: Prepare a sample PDF file that you'll use to perform text search operations.

## Import Namespaces
First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project to access the GroupDocs.Parser functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of the Parser Class
To begin, instantiate the `Parser` class by specifying the path to your sample PDF file:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("Path_to_Your_PDF_File.pdf"))
{
    // Your code for text search will go here
}
```
Replace `"Path_to_Your_PDF_File.pdf"` with the actual path to your PDF file.
## Step 2: Search Text Using Regular Expression
Inside the `using` block of the `Parser` instance, execute a text search operation using a regular expression. This example demonstrates searching for the word "the" with case matching enabled:
```csharp
IEnumerable<SearchResult> searchResults = parser.Search("\\sthe\\s", new SearchOptions(true, false, true));
foreach (SearchResult result in searchResults)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"At {result.Position}: {result.Text}");
}
```
- `\\sthe\\s`: This regular expression searches for the exact word "the" with surrounding spaces (word boundary).
- `new SearchOptions(true, false, true)`: These options configure the search to perform case-sensitive (`true`), whole-word (`false`), and regular expression (`true`) matching.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to utilize GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to search for text in PDF documents using regular expressions. This library simplifies complex document parsing tasks, making it easier to extract and manipulate textual data within your .NET applications.
