# Search Text in Excel Document by Regular Expression

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to search for specific text patterns within Excel documents using regular expressions. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful library that allows developers to extract text and metadata from various document formats, including spreadsheets like Excel. By leveraging regular expressions, we can perform advanced text searches efficiently.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following set up:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio or another compatible IDE for .NET development.
2. GroupDocs.Parser for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
3. Sample Excel File: Prepare a sample Excel file that contains the text you want to search.

## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces to use GroupDocs.Parser in your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
Begin by creating an instance of the `Parser` class, passing the path to your Excel document as a parameter.
```csharp
// Create an instance of Parser class
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.xlsx"))
{
    // Code continues here...
}
```
## Step 2: Perform Regular Expression Search
Within the `using` block, perform a text search using a regular expression pattern.
```csharp
// Search with a regular expression with case matching
IEnumerable<SearchResult> searchResults = parser.Search("\\sthe\\s", new SearchOptions(true, false, true));
```
- Regex Pattern Explanation:
  - `\\sthe\\s`: This regex pattern searches for the word "the" (case-sensitive) surrounded by whitespace.
## Step 3: Iterate Over Search Results
Next, iterate through the search results to access each matching occurrence.
```csharp
// Iterate over search results
foreach (SearchResult result in searchResults)
{
    // Print the position and found text
    Console.WriteLine($"At {result.Position}: {result.Text}");
}
```
- Output:
  - This loop will print out each occurrence of the specified text pattern along with its position within the document.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to perform a regular expression search within Excel documents. By following these steps, you can integrate advanced text search capabilities into your .NET applications efficiently.
