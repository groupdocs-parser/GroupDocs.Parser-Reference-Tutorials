## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of extracting text from an Excel document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful .NET library that allows you to parse various document formats, including Excel files, to extract text and metadata.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment set up for .NET development, including Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
2. GroupDocs.Parser Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Parser library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
3. Sample Excel Document: Prepare a sample Excel document from which you want to extract text.

## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code to use the GroupDocs.Parser functionality.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
```
## Step 1: Create an Instance of Parser Class
To begin, create an instance of the `Parser` class by providing the path to your sample Excel file.
```csharp
// Create an instance of Parser class
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.xlsx"))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
## Step 2: Extract Text using TextReader
Next, use the `GetText()` method of the `Parser` class to extract text from the Excel document. This method returns a `TextReader` object.
```csharp
// Extract a text into the reader
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText())
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
## Step 3: Read and Print the Extracted Text
Now, use the `ReadToEnd()` method of the `TextReader` object to read the extracted text from the Excel document and print it to the console or use it as needed in your application.
```csharp
// Print the extracted text
Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());
```
