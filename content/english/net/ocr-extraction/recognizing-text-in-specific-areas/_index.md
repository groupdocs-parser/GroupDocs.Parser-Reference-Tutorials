## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GroupDocs.Parser for .NET to recognize and extract text from specific areas within a document. GroupDocs.Parser is a powerful document parsing library that allows developers to work with various document formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. Specifically, we will focus on leveraging the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities of GroupDocs.Parser to extract text from defined areas within a document.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Visual Studio IDE: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine.
2. GroupDocs.Parser for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Parser for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/).
3. Document Samples: Prepare sample files (e.g., PDF, DOCX) from which you want to extract text.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.OCR;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
```

Let's break down the process into detailed steps using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET:
## Step 1: Create Parser Settings with OCR Connector
First, create an instance of `ParserSettings` class and initialize it with an OCR connector, such as `AsposeOcrOnPremise`:
```csharp
ParserSettings settings = new ParserSettings(new AsposeOcrOnPremise());
```
## Step 2: Instantiate Parser with Settings
Next, create an instance of `Parser` class by passing the previously created `ParserSettings`:
```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser("YourSampleFile.pdf", settings))
{
    // Code snippet continues...
}
```
Replace `"YourSampleFile.pdf"` with the path to your target document.
## Step 3: Configure Text Area Extraction Options
Create an instance of `PageTextAreaOptions` to enable OCR-based text extraction:
```csharp
PageTextAreaOptions options = new PageTextAreaOptions(true);
```
Set `true` to enable OCR for better text recognition.
## Step 4: Extract Text Areas
Invoke `parser.GetTextAreas(options)` to extract text areas from the document:
```csharp
IEnumerable<PageTextArea> areas = parser.GetTextAreas(options);
```
## Step 5: Process Extracted Text Areas
Iterate over the extracted text areas and retrieve text, position, and size information:
```csharp
foreach (PageTextArea area in areas)
{
    Console.WriteLine(area.Text);
    Console.WriteLine($"\tPosition: ({area.Rectangle.Left}; {area.Rectangle.Top})");
    Console.WriteLine($"\tSize: ({area.Rectangle.Size.Width}; {area.Rectangle.Size.Height})");
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the process of extracting text from specific areas within a document using GroupDocs.Parser for .NET with OCR capabilities. By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the parsing functionalities of GroupDocs.Parser to handle text extraction tasks programmatically.
