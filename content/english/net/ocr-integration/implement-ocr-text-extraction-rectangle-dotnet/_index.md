## How to Extract Text from Defined Rectangular Areas Using OCR in GroupDocs.Parser for .NET

Ever stared at a scanned document and wondered how you could just grab that specific section of text locked in a box or label? What if you could point to a rectangle on that image and say, ‚ÄúHey, OCR, just read this part‚Äù? Well, that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre going to learn today.

In this hands-on tutorial, we‚Äôre diving into **OCR text extraction** using **GroupDocs.Parser for .NET** ‚Äî and not just any OCR. We‚Äôre talking about defining **precise rectangular areas** so you extract exactly what you want, nothing more, nothing less.

This guide will walk you through every step like we‚Äôre building it side by side. By the end, you'll know how to extract text from targeted image areas with pinpoint accuracy. Ready to dive in?


## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let's make sure your setup is ready to rock. Here's what you'll need:

* ‚úÖ [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) (preferably .NET Core 3.1+ or .NET 5/6/7)
* ‚úÖ [GroupDocs.Parser for .NET](https://releases.groupdocs.com/parser/net/) library installed
* ‚úÖ An image-based document (scanned PDF or image) that contains text
* ‚úÖ A valid [GroupDocs temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) if you're evaluating without watermarks
* ‚úÖ [Aspose.OCR](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/) installed as an OCR engine (on-premise version)


## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary namespaces. These give you access to all the OCR and parsing functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Parser;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Data;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Options;
using GroupDocs.Parser.Ocr;
```


## Step-by-Step Guide: Extracting OCR Text from a Defined Rectangle

Let‚Äôs break the full example down piece by piece so you really get what‚Äôs going on.


### Step 1: Initialize OCR Settings with Aspose.OCR

You can‚Äôt perform OCR without telling GroupDocs how to do it. Here, we‚Äôre hooking it up with **Aspose.OCR on-premise**.

```csharp
ParserSettings settings = new ParserSettings(new AsposeOcrOnPremise());
```

#### üí° Why this matters:

You're telling the parser, ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt just look at the file. If there‚Äôs an image with text, use OCR and decode it!‚Äù Aspose.OCR is like the brain here that can understand those scanned text blobs.


### Step 2: Load the File with Parser and OCR Settings

Now that our OCR engine is ready, let‚Äôs load a document ‚Äî say, a scanned invoice or ID card.

```csharp
using (Parser parser = new Parser(Constants.SampleScan, settings))
```

#### What‚Äôs happening here?

You‚Äôre creating a new parser object and feeding it a file, while also passing the OCR engine settings so it knows how to handle image-based text.


### Step 3: Define the Area to Extract Text From

We don‚Äôt want the entire page ‚Äî just a part of it. Let‚Äôs say we want to extract text from a 400x200 rectangle starting at the top-left corner.

```csharp
OcrOptions ocrOptions = new OcrOptions(new Data.Rectangle(0, 0, 400, 200));
```

#### üîç Why this is crucial:

OCR can be time-consuming if you're scanning the whole image. This step allows us to **focus only on what's necessary**, like targeting just the name field on a form. Imagine using a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer ‚Äî precision is everything.


### Step 4: Set OCR Options in TextOptions

This step tells GroupDocs, ‚ÄúHey, we want to extract text using OCR, and we‚Äôre only looking at the defined rectangle.‚Äù

```csharp
TextOptions options = new TextOptions(false, true, ocrOptions);
```

#### üß† What do those parameters mean?

* `false`: Don't extract text from the entire document
* `true`: Use OCR for extraction
* `ocrOptions`: Only look at our defined rectangle

Boom. That‚Äôs laser focus.


### Step 5: Perform Text Extraction

Now it‚Äôs time to grab that sweet, sweet text from our image.

```csharp
using (TextReader reader = parser.GetText(options))
{
    Console.WriteLine(reader == null ? "Text extraction isn't supported" : reader.ReadToEnd());
}
```

#### üéØ Final goal:

This reads the text within that rectangle using OCR and prints it to the console. If it doesn't support text extraction (for example, if the image is blank or unreadable), it lets you know.


## Conclusion

And that‚Äôs a wrap! You‚Äôve just learned how to **perform OCR on specific rectangular areas** using **GroupDocs.Parser for .NET**. This technique is a game-changer when you need **targeted text extraction** ‚Äî like pulling out names, dates, or reference numbers from forms, IDs, or invoices.

Think about how much faster and cleaner this is compared to processing an entire page every time. It‚Äôs like going straight for the treasure without digging up the whole field.

With just a few lines of code, you‚Äôve got full control over what gets read and when. Efficient, smart, and scalable.


## FAQs

### 1. Can I extract multiple rectangular areas in a single pass?

Yes, but you'll need to define multiple `OcrOptions` and loop through them, extracting each block separately.

### 2. What image formats are supported for OCR with GroupDocs.Parser?

Common formats like PNG, JPG, TIFF, and scanned PDFs are fully supported.

### 3. Does GroupDocs.Parser include OCR functionality out of the box?

No. You need to plug in an OCR engine like [Aspose.OCR](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/) or any other supported connector.

### 4. Can I use OCR on PDFs that have mixed content (text and image)?

Absolutely! Just make sure you point the OCR engine to the right section ‚Äî the image parts.

### 5. Is it possible to use a cloud-based OCR engine instead of an on-premise one?

Currently, GroupDocs.Parser supports on-premise OCR engines like Aspose.OCR, but cloud integration might require custom connectors.
