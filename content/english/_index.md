## How does document parsing work with GroupDocs.Parser?

GroupDocs.Parser abstracts the complexities of each file format behind a single, consistent .NET or Java API. You load a document once, then call specialized extractors (text, table, image, barcode, OCR, etc.). The library handles format‑specific quirks, so you can focus on business logic instead of file‑format gymnastics.

- **Broad format support** – Over 50 formats including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, EPUB, email files, and archives.  
- **Advanced extraction features** – Formatted text, layout preservation, barcode detection, OCR, and template‑based data extraction.  
- **Performance‑optimized** – Low memory footprint and fast processing for large files.  
- **Zero external dependencies** – No need for Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, or other third‑party installations.

## Getting the most out of the GroupDocs.Parser tutorial

- **Start with the “Getting Started” guide** for your platform to set up the SDK, obtain a temporary license, and run your first extraction.  
- **Pick a use‑case** (e.g., table extraction for financial reports) and follow the dedicated tutorial; the step‑by‑step code shows exactly which classes and methods to call.  
- **Combine features** – you can run OCR on an image‑only PDF, then extract the resulting text and any barcodes in a single pipeline.  
- **Performance tip:** When processing large batches, reuse the `Parser` instance and enable streaming mode to keep memory usage low.  
- **Troubleshooting:** If a document fails to load, check the file format support table in the API reference and verify that the file isn’t password‑protected unless you supply the password.

## Next steps

Now that you’ve explored the full suite of **GroupDocs.Parser tutorial** resources, you can:

1. Clone the sample projects from the GitHub repository.  
2. Integrate the parser into your existing .NET or Java service.
